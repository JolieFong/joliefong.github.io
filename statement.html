  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My theme for my projects all cover a similar topic of being careful. I wanted to create scenarios that are relatable for some and to alert others to be cautious.I also want people to notice the dangers before they experience it. I focused on the theme of being cautious because San Jose can be very dangerous and how widespread the internet is can either help or cause distress.</p>
  <p>I kept up the danger theme for my first three projects, when I hit the final project, I changed my theme a little. It still shows some dangers, which are from personal experience, but it's not very widespread. I focused on oppression, I had been oppressed by my parents and I wanted to touch on how depressed it made me feel, which is dangerous. But I also wanted to show how I changed and grew, which was when I fell in love with my boyfriend. This video was the progress of how far I've come from a dangerous emotional state to freedom.</p>
