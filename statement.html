  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My theme for my projects all cover a similar topic of being careful. I wanted to create scenarios that are relatable for some and to alert others to be cautious.I also want people to notice the dangers before they experience it. I focused on the theme of being cautious because San Jose can be very dangerous and how widespread the internet is can either help or cause distress.</p>
