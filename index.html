    <p> I wanted to portray what to watch out for when creating a media platform, specifically Youtube. I've seen some youtubers fall for the scam and end up with bad experiences and I didn't want this to happen to anyone else so I made a video showign the dangers behind MCNs.</p>

     <p> I used found footage of people walking with people with certain intervals of pounding on the camera in order to scare people along with a mirror on the end of the hall with bloody handprints. I made it in order to show that there are dangerous people everywhere even possibly walking with you.</p>

<p> I explored the concept of cyberbullying in this piece. For the website, I made it so you could "connect" to the internet and it would show you that others need help. If you click disconnect, you'd be scolded for abandoning and have the option to reconnect. All pages link to each other someway. I just want people who have been cyberbullied to be noticed and not ignored. If someone is told to die, someone should say something because sometimes, it does hurt and those people need support.</p>

    <p>In this piece, I explored my feelings of which led me to this art path. I also show what changed my life and was the most important factor in my change of an art career. I really wanted to give some insight into the expectations and how trapped and depressed I felt. I also wanted to show how I got out of the darkness and feelings that I couldn't handle anymore.</p>
<p>I'm making this to host my portfolio for free. To learn more, read my <a href="statement.html">artist's statement.</a></p>
